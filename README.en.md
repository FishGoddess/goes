**Goes** is a easy-to-use and lightweight lib for executing async tasks.

[é˜…è¯»ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆçš„æ–‡æ¡£](./README.md)

### ðŸ¥‡ Features

* Limits the number of simultaneous goroutines and not reuses them by Limiter.
* Limits the number of simultaneous goroutines and reuses them by Executor.
* Supports multiple scheduling strategies, including round robin, random, etc.
* Supports spin lock with backoff strategy.
* Supports getting the number of workers available in the executor.

### ðŸš€ How to use

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/FishGoddess/goes
```

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/FishGoddess/goes"
)

func main() {
	// Limits the number of simultaneous goroutines and not reuses them.
	limiter := goes.NewLimiter(4)

	for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
		limiter.Go(func() {
			fmt.Println("limiter --> ", time.Now())
			time.Sleep(time.Second)
		})
	}

	limiter.Wait()

	// Limits the number of simultaneous goroutines and reuses them.
	executor := goes.NewExecutor(4)
	defer executor.Close()

	for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
		executor.Submit(func() {
			fmt.Println("executor --> ", time.Now())
			time.Sleep(time.Second)
		})
	}
}
```

> Obviously, goes.Executor is 5x faster than ants.Pool which has more features, so try goes if you prefer a lightweight and faster executor.
